# Delta-Robot
Delta Robot done with TI RM42

Unfortunately, I don't have most of the files with which I made this project. 
Still, the board configuration is at the end of the attached PDF. 

I hope it is useful. This was a team effort. Remember that if you use anything, you can give us credit; it's not mandatory, but it would be nice.
